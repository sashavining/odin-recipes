        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup room temperature vegan margarine, more for the pan</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3/4 cup lightly packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup molasses</li>
            <li>Egg replacer for 1 egg, such as Ener-g or Bob's Red Mill, made according to package instructions</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract </li>
            <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F. Lightly grease two baking sheets. </li>
            <li>Combine the flour with the cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, allspice, baking soda and pepper. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Using an electric mixer, beat together the vegan margarine, brown sugar, and molasses until well combined and as light and fluffy as you can get it.  </li>
            <li>Add in the prepared egg replacer and vanilla, again beating until well combined and as fluffy as possible.  </li>
            <li>Gradually beat in the dry ingredients, mixing until well combined. The dough should be a bit more dry and crumbly.</li>
            <li>Roll the cookie dough into 1-inch balls and place them on prepared cookie sheets. Do not flatten. If the dough is too crumbly, you can moisten your hands a bit when rolling the dough to get it to stick together.  </li>
            <li>Bake the cookies for 13 to 15 minutes, until just starting to crack; do not over-bake.  </li>
            <li>Allow the cookies to cool, then gently roll in confectioners' sugar until completely coated. You can also place the sugar in a bag or a bowl and gently roll the cookies around.   </li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
